Focused Viral Metagenome Assembly Experiment
============================================================

Research Question:
What is the optimal co-assembly group size for viral metagenomes?
(Balancing low-abundance recovery against strain-mixing artifacts)

Literature-Informed Design:
- Total samples: 200
- Strategies: 5 (down from 17 in original design)
- Cost reduction: ~85% (1,500 vs 10,000 CPU hours)
- Statistical power: High with {len(samples)} samples

Strategies Created:

1. Individual Assembly (Baseline)
   - 200 separate assemblies
   - Literature: Maximum strain resolution
   - File: results/focused_strategies/individual/assembly_recommendations.json

2. Groups of 5 Samples
   - 40 groups, 200 grouped
   - Literature: Optimal pool size (Nature 2021)
   - File: results/focused_strategies/groups_size_5/assembly_recommendations.json

3. Groups of 12 Samples
   - 17 groups, 200 grouped
   - Literature: Small-medium group size
   - File: results/focused_strategies/groups_size_12/assembly_recommendations.json

4. Groups of 25 Samples
   - 8 groups, 200 grouped
   - Literature: Medium group balancing coverage vs diversity
   - File: results/focused_strategies/groups_size_25/assembly_recommendations.json

5. Global Assembly
   - All 200 samples together
   - Literature: Maximum low-abundance recovery
   - File: results/focused_strategies/global/assembly_recommendations.json

Next Steps:
1. Generate assembly commands for all 5 strategies
2. Run MEGAHIT → Flye pipeline
3. Analyze with CheckV for viral genome completeness
4. Compare strain diversity vs low-abundance recovery
5. Determine optimal group size for viral metagenomes
